# [vimrc](https://github.com/tbhaskar78/vimrc)

   - this is the vimrc I use for my development in C/C++/python. But extremely useful for other things as well.
   - I use clang_complete for auto completions which speeds up the rate of development. Moved away from omnicppcomplete which did not work well with STL
   - I use the desert theme, which I absolutely love
   - I have mapped keys for DOXYGEN
   - Mapped keys for building based on C/C++/Python filetypes

Hope you find this useful!
